# DSA Project - Maze Game

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**-based application developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course project.

---

## Description

The **Maze Game** is an interactive, graphical C++ application that demonstrates the practical application of various data structures and algorithms. Players navigate through a maze with increasing difficulty, utilizing **pathfinding algorithms** to find a solution while avoiding obstacles.

This project features a **GUI-based interface** built in **C++ using Visual Studio 2022**, ensuring an engaging user experience. Instead of predefined mazes, the game now **generates random mazes** dynamically using **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to create valid paths from the start to the finish of each level.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic maze generation** using DFS and BFS for unique challenges in every session.
- **Customizable maze environment** with varied obstacles and difficulty settings.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms** implemented to ensure solvable mazes.
- **Multiple difficulty levels** with increasing maze complexity. The default is **5 levels**, but this can be adjusted globally.
- **Interactive gameplay** with intuitive controls for smooth navigation.
- **Bonus points system** for faster level completion.
- **Teleportation functionality** to transition between maze levels.
- **Smooth GUI** for enhanced visual appeal and user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Data Structures:** 3D vectors for maze representation.
- **Algorithms:**  
  - **Maze Generation:** DFS and BFS (Implemented)  
  - **Pathfinding (Upcoming):** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A* Search  
- **Platform:** GUI-based application built in **Visual Studio 2022**.
